> This is an install file for a MATLAB application. Just open it with MATLAB and it will install, or go to APPS -> Install App and open the file. Once installed, it will be listed under the APPS tab. If you prefer to have the .m files, then extract all the files (use any unzip tool on the .mlappinstall file). The top level file is called "GPR_LayerTracker.mlapp"
